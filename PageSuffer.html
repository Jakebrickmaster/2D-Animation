                    <h2> Differences</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 150%"> In the past 20 years or so, the use of 3D animation has sky-rocketed. It was simply more appealing for people to watch. This was proven with the first 3D animated film, Toy Story by 

                        Pixar in 1995. After that, the demand for more 3D animated films increased drastically. This also made it more profitable. In the 2D realm, Disney had been most popular for its entertaining 2D animations, but the popularity of 3D animations simply overshadowed any and all 2D animations.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 150%">While 3D animations are more profitable, that doesn't necessarily make it better. Most 3D animated movies now are popular mostly for the story, not the animation. While both styles have many similarities, there are still complexities between the two. Some things are harder to animate in one style rather than the other.  It is much more efficient to make a 3D model of something in a 3D animation and it gets more use out of it. As with 2D animation, each drawn frame is rarely used more than once. </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 150%">However, physically creating these animations is a whole other issue. 2D animations consist of consistently drawn art pieces, which can be done much faster than 3D modeling. When making 3D models for animations, there is a lot of coding and math that goes into it, making it cost so much more to create for the market. This also makes 3D animating much more time consuming; making sure the 3D model actually does what it's coded to do (in which if something goes wrong, you'll have to go through the trouble of searching through the code for hours upon hours for the code error). Whereas in 2D animating, you simply have to adjust any mistakes in the art piece you made.</p>  

                    <p style="font-size: 150%">There are many more differences between the 2 styles, but there is a video at the top of this page that goes into much greater detail with this. </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 150%">There really is no over-all better style of animating, it's just personal preference. There is no need to throw away one style over the other. Some style work better in certain countries. Take Japan for example and their animes. People all over Japan, even the world, find this style of 2D animating extremely entertaining to watch visually. The same goes for countries like the United States of America. There are people who visually prefer things like anime over 3D animated movies(myself included). They can't really be described with words on which is better, it's just which style catches your eye better.
