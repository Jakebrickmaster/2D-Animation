                <p style="font-size: 150%"> I am 17 years old, youngest out of 4, and prefers to work alone. I've been doing animation for about 3 years. Most of it was stop motion, but for the past 3-4 months or so, I've been practicing 2D flash animations with Macromedia flash. I don't do just animations though; I've gotten practice with grahic designing and digital art as well. However, doing animations would be my favoirte out of the three. I've seen many animation in this style, and for the longest time, I've wanted to do something similar. I do all the animating by myself, but instead of drawing characters, I use and make sprite sheets of character and any special effects I need. most of it is Sonic the Hedgehog related though, but that's just because of preference.

                <p style="font-size: 150%"> Being an animator myself, I chose to research this topic out of curiosity. This is something I enjoy and I was curious what would happen if I tried to get a job of it. One, I've gotten familiar with what it takes to being in this field, and two, I <i>might</i> consider starting this as a career(emphasis on might). It would be way too hard to get a job in this field, seeing that 3D animating is the big thing now(which I have tried, never doing it again).</p>
